◉ 👋 Hi, beep boop, .... 👾
◉ I am Silvio in Pixels, only Silvio for friends 🫡 
◉ Currently living/working between Split and Zagreb / aiming for move to Athens soon 🤞🤞
◉ I am open for remot jobs as well, be free to contact me via e-mail (contact info -> Line )  

👀 I’m interested in development, design and teachings in several IT fields. 
- If I could pick my favourite language it would be Solidity, but I also speak fluent English, and ofc. Croatian as my native one :D  

▶︎ I entered Ethereum ecosystem somewhere in 2016. from when I actively involve in ETHerean's comunity. 
Fast foward from basics, gains and loses lets jump to NFTs; I minted my first NFT on Rarible on first Q of 2020
but I like to say my NFTs journey started later that year when I switched from Rarible to OpenSea in October. 
▶︎ My lucky level and my NFTs learning curve (racing with ideas, project planning, motion / gfx design, minting, NFTs marketing, selling...) was magical🫠  
I was lucky enough to ride wave of cheap Layer1 transactions and I use it to dive deeper into digital art and NFTs. 

▶︎ But it didn't stop there, I am ENS (Ethereum Name Service) early adopter, 
and other than selling/teaching about crypto art I like to buy,sell and flip crypto/Web3.0 domains.

▶︎▶︎▶︎ Interests: 
▶︎ I like to float in pixels using different power apps like LumaFusion, FCPX, Procreate, Photoshop and Blender, just to mention few.
▶︎ SuperSecrectFact: I’m currently learning different aproaches to ARM technology.

▶︎ Other than that I am interested in multiple fields of IT with Blockchain technology as main one. 

▶︎▶︎▶︎ Mobile Developing:
▶︎ Swift is my secret crush, and I definetly see myself absorb more skills/speed; 
depends on app type and test drive period I am available for beta testing/bughunt.
